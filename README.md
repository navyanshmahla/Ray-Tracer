# A simple Ray Tracer

This is a simple ray tracer that I built after learning ray tracing from <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">this</a> excellent resource!
I'v also used SDL2 in order to represent the images in a window, quite a hassle to view ppm files directly in mac.

The ray tracer has functionalities like anti-aliasing, diffuse material reflection, etc. 

The following are some images rendered using this ray tracer:

![](./img_asset/image_hitable_antialias.png)
![](./img_asset/image_diffuse_light.png)
![](./img_asset/image_diffuse_dark.png)

I'll be working more on this ray tracer to add more functionalities like mirrored reflection to it!!
